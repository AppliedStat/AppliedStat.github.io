excerpt: "Goodness-of-Fit Test for Weibull Distribution"
collection: R
---
This R package performs a <i>goodness-of-fit test for Weibull distribution</i> (weibullness test) and
provides the parameter estimates of the two- and three-parameter Weibull distributions.
Note that the threshold parameter is estimated based on the correlation from the Weibull plot.
