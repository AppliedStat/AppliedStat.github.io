title: "weibullness" 
excerpt: "Goodness-of-Fit Test for Weibull Distribution"
collection: R
---
This R package conducts a goodness-of-fit test for the Weibull distribution (referred to as the weibullness test) and 
furnishes parameter estimations for both the two-parameter and three-parameter Weibull distributions. 
Notably, the threshold parameter is derived through correlation from the Weibull plot. 
Additionally, this package conducts goodness-of-fit assessments for the exponential, Gumbel, and inverse Weibull distributions, 
accompanied by parameter estimations.  For more details, see
