excerpt: "Goodness-of-Fit Test for Weibull and Three-parameter Weibull"
collection: R
---
This R package performs a <i>goodness-of-fit test of Weibull distribution</i>
(weibullness test) and
provides the maximum likelihood estimates of the three-parameter Weibull distribution.
Note that the threshold parameter is estimated based on the correlation from the Weibull plot.
