Description
======
+ Mathematical Statistics (DE-76044) will focus on the theories of statistics.  <br />
+ First Topics (probability part) covered in this class include basic distribution theories and
 various probability distributions such as binomial, negative binomial, Poisson, exponential, normal,
bivariate, etc.
+ Second Topics (statistics part) covered in this class include point estimation, 
  interval estimation, sampling, linear regression, and statistical hypothesis testing.
+ We will also study various statistical applications widely used for engineering. 
  The popular [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) 
  or Rstudio will be handled in this class.
