Description
======
+ Engineering Statistics I (IE-24210) 
  will focus on basic concepts and theories of probability and statistics.  <br />
+  Topics covered in this class include basic distribution theories and
 various probability distributions such
as binomial, negative binomial, Poisson, exponential, normal,
bivariate, etc.
+ We will also study various limit and approximation techniques widely
used for probability and statistics.
+ The popular [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) 
  or Rstudio will be handled in this class.

Objectives
