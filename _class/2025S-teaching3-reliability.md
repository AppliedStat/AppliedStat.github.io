Description
======
+ Reliability Engineering (IE-2700581) will focus on developing an understanding
of the concepts of reliability theory and their applications to practical problems
from engineering, life science, etc. 
+ Topics covered in this class include:
(i) Review of old material: probability, random Variables, expectation, variance, etc.
(ii) System reliability.
(iii) Parametric estimation methods.
(iv) Types of censoring.
(v) Parametric lifetime models.
(vi) Linear models.
(vii) Basic accelerated lifetime models.
+ The popular [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) 
  or Rstudio will be handled in this class.
