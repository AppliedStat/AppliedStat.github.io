Description
======
+ First, the course will review basic linear models in statistics 
  including simple regression, multiple regression, regression 
  with categorical variables and polynomials, etc.
+ After studying basic linear regression models, 
  we will focus on general F-test, basic model selection methods, 
  and building appropriate models.
+ Time permitting, we will also consider how to deal with outliers 
  and influential observations. 
+ The popular [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/), 
  [Python3](https://www.python.org/), and [Minitab](https://www.minitab.com/) will be handled in this class.
+ We will also consider various practical applications widely used for engineering. 


Objectives 
======
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Program statistical softwares (Minitab and R). 
1. Derive parameter estimates under the simple linear regression model. 
1. Do basic statistical inference for the simple linear regression model. 
1. Know how to use matrix algebra in regression models. 
1. Extend the simple linear regression model to the
      multiple linear regression model using the matrix algebra. 
1. Set up polynomial regression models. 
1. Analyze and infer the multiple linear regression model. 
1. Understand how to diagnose the problems from regression models. 
1. Know the general linear _F_-test. 
1. Use categorical predictor variables in the regression model setup. 
1. Use _all possible regression._ 
1. Understand several  model selection procedures. 
1. Build an appropriate model. 
1. Detect outliers and influential observations.
