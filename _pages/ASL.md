<B>Welcome to Applied Statistics Laboratory (ASL) at Pusan National University (PNU).</B><br/>
<I>Our motto is "Data Reduction with Information."</I><br/>

<font size="-1"> 
<P>
The Applied Statistics Laboratory (응용통계연구실) was established 
by Professor Chanseok Park (박찬석) in the Department of Industrial Engineering 
at Pusan National University on March 2, 2016. 
The room has been shared with the Dr. Gyu M. LEE's lab by September 2017. 
Since then, the lab moved to a new place and is now located at Rm 10-516 (ASL Lab I) 
and 10-517 (ASL Lab II) in Engineering Building #10 of Pusan National University. 
Professor Park had been at Rm 10-618, right next door to Dr. Gyu M. LEE, by January, 2018. 
On the 18th of January, 2018, he also moved to a new office at Rm 10-527 of the same building.
</P>

<P>
As the director of the Applied Statistics Laboratory, 
Professor Park leads the applied statistics group, teaches statistics courses, 
and carries out various research projects on applied statistics and engineering fields 
including quality and reliability engineering, competing risks model, statistical computing, 
solid mechanics, etc. The theoretical areas such as finite-sample properties, 
robustness and minimum distance methods are also carried out in the lab. 
</P>

<P>
His research and the members in the lab have been supported by several research funds 
including the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea, 
the International Cooperation Program by the NRF and the National Natural Science Foundation 
of China, Two-Year Research Grant of PNU, CK-1 fund by the NRF, 
the 6th BRIDGE grant of PNU, the PNU Grant 2015, etc. 
</P>
