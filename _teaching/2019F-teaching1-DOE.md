Experimental Design and Regression Analysis 
is an undergraduate course for Fall, 2019.


Description
======
+ In this course, various statistical theories will be studied, including experimental design and regression analysis.
+ In order to incorporate the theories into practical problems, the popular [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) or Rstudio will be handled in this class.


Objectives 
======
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand the simple linear regression model.                          
1. Estimate the parameters under the linear regression model.
1. Perform basic statistical inference for the linear regression model. 
1. Know how to use matrix algebra in regression models.
1. Analyze and infer the multiple linear regression model.
1. Use categorical predictor variables in the regression model setup.
1. Understand the connection between regression and experimental design.
1. Understand basics on ANOVA (analysis of variance).
1. Understand the randomized complete block design.
1. Understand and design factorial experiments.
1. Program statistical softwares (Minitab and R).
