Description
======
+ Linear Algebra (IE-15570) will focus on 
  basic concepts and theories of linear algebra with engineering applications.  <br />
+ Basic topics covered in this class include basic vector and matrix representations,
   determinant, solution of a system of linear equations, 
   independence/dependence concepts, vector space/subspace, etc. 
+ In addition, we will also study various applied topics such as 
  linear transformation, eigen-value/eigen-vector, diagonalization,
   inner product space, Gram Schmidt orthogonalication, least squares problems, etc.
   
+ The popular [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) 
  will be handled in this class.

Objectives 
======
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand basic concepts on vector and matrix representation.
1. Solve a system of linear equations using the linear algebra. 
1. Diagonalize a matrix. 
1. Decompose a matrix with a diagonal matrix and eigen-vectors.
1. Incorporate the linear algebra technique into various engineering problems.
